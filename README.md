# LogarithmicALU
Design a simple model that provides logarithmic and anti- logarithmic operations in arithmetic logic unit that uses the principle of Linear piece-wise approximation. 

The aim of our project is to design a simple model that provides logarithmic and anti-
logarithmic operations in arithmetic logic unit that uses the principle of Linear piece-wise
approximation. The linear approximation method reduces the latency factor, consumes less
power and area as compared to the conventional methods that use multipliers and Look-Up
Tables. The logarithmic processing unit receive the input in form of 
oating point number
that has sign, an exponent, and mantissa, and output is a xed point number which has
an integer and a fraction. The anti-logarithmic unit has input as xed point number and
output as 
oating point number. The log/anti-log unit can reduce the computation time of
operations of multiplication, division and other complex calculations.
